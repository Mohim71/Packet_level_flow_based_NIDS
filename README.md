Flow Reconstruction Using Payload-Byte

This repository contains an extended version of the Payload-Byte labeling pipeline, modified to additionally reconstruct flows and packet-level ordering from PCAP files.
The aim of this project is to take raw network traffic, generate packet-level labels, and enrich them with metadata required for downstream flow-based analysis.
